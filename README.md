# Portfolio Frontend ![](screenshots/coffee-logo.png)

A frontend for a Portfolio site, made using React, TypeScript, and SASS.

The purpose of this project was to be part of a larger-scale portfolio project built with an Express web-server backend and React UI frontend. My hope was that in living through the unforseen growing pains of a project in motion, I would come to better understand these technologies than I had up until this point. This proved to be true, and building the frontend and backend components has laid the foundation for my knowledge with React and Express respectively.

## Functonality

The site is designed with a public-facing main side as well as a private, admin-accessible route for managing the data presented.

Most users will view the public-facing site - here they can view and filter various projects and blog posts made on the platform by keyword or tag.

From the admin page, individual instances of our data models can be added, updated, or removed.
